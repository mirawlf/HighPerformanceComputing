**OpenMP part**

***Axisb.cpp*** - implementation of Jacobi method for solving linear system of equation (matrix of cofficients and array of free coefficients are generatet randomly and this is the problem for the convergence of solution)

***BugParFor.c, BugReduction.c*** - the task for that programs was to identify and fix the mistakes in code

***MatMul.c*** - ijk algorithm of matrix multiplication realized in parallel manner

***MonteCarloPi.c*** - Monte-Carlo parallel calculation of Pi value 

***Pi.c*** - parallel calculation of Pi value with the help of OpenMP
