Homeworks from High Performance Computing and Modern Architectures course

**OpenMP part**

***Axisb.cpp*** - implementation of Jacobi method for solving linear system of equation (matrix of cofficients and array of free coefficients are generatet randomly and this is the problem for the convergence of solution)

***Axisb2.cpp*** - implementation of Jacobi method for solving linear system of equation. The code was brought from <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Метод_Гаусса_—_Зейделя_решения_системы_линейных_уравнений>, I just added parallelization mechanism

***BugParFor.c, BugReduction.c*** - the task for that programs was to identify and fix the mistakes in code

***MatMul.c*** - ijk algorithm of matrix multiplication realized in parallel manner

***MonteCarloPi.c*** - Monte-Carlo parallel calculation of Pi value 

***Pi.c*** - parallel calculation of Pi value with the help of OpenMP

***Car.cpp*** - code for shifting an image (example: car.ppm -> new_car.ppm)
